# 🍊 Orange vs Grapefruit Binary Classifier

This repository contains a **binary classifier** project developed in `Python` as part of my **B.Tech 4th Year Computer Science and Engineering** coursework at *Graphic Era University* 🏫.

📄 The classifier distinguishes between oranges and grapefruits based on a simple, two-feature dataset. The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.  
👉 Sample datasets and code are provided in the repository.

> ✅ **Note:** The project is implemented in **Python 3.x** and requires standard data science libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

## ⚙️ How to Set Up the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raghavshuklaofficial/Orange-vs-Grapefruit-Binary-Classifier.git
cd Orange-vs-Grapefruit-Binary-Classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

✔️ This will install all required dependencies for running the code and notebooks.

## 🚀 Running the Classifier

You can run the project in two ways:

1. **Jupyter Notebook**  
   Open the notebook in the `notebooks/` folder for a step-by-step demonstration of the classification pipeline.

2. **Python Script**  
   Run the main script in the `src/` folder for a command-line workflow.

## 🧩 Project Features

- **Binary Classification**: Differentiates between oranges and grapefruits using measurable features.
- **Simple Dataset**: Uses features like *weight* and *diameter* for easy interpretation.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
- **Reproducible Results**: All steps are documented for easy replication.

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset contains measurements for both oranges and grapefruits. Each record includes:

- **Color** (red , green , blue i.e. RGB Values)
- **Weight** (in grams)
- **Diameter** (in centimeters)
- **Label** ("orange" or "grapefruit")

The dataset is small and ideal for educational purposes.

| Model Evaluation        | Uses accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation for assessment            |


## 🚀 Future Work

- Experiment with more advanced models or additional features.
- Deploy the classifier as a simple web application for interactive use.
- Extend the dataset to include more fruit types.
